# transistor-amp
Simple transistor amplifier for Hack Club Solder 


This amplifier is based on the highly popular LM386 op-amp chip, although it has been somewhat downgraded for the sake of low component count (eg no constant current source, etc)

### Features
 - Class AB for higher efficiency
 - Runs on ~6V (2xCR2032 or external power supply input)
 - Small size, crammed in just over 3 square inches
 - Decent performance in SPICE simulation
   - higher THD than the original IC but not too bad
 - 250mW power output (yeah that's pretty low ðŸ˜­)
